@Elhorst.2014 provides a comprehensive introduction to spatial panel data methods. Article length introduction to spatial panel data models (FE and RE) can be found in @Elhorst.2012, @Millo.2012 and @Croissant.2018. @LeSage.2014b discusses Bayesian panel data methods.

Note that we will only discuss some basics here, as the complete econometrics of these models and their estimation strategy become insanely complicated [@Lee.2010].

## Static panel data models

The idea behind a static panel data with auto-regressive term is similar to the cross sectional situation [@Millo.2012].


$$
		{\bm y}= +\rho(\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm y}+{\bm X}{\bm \beta}+ {\bm u}.
$$	

where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product (block-wise multiplication).

$$
\begin{split}
\underbrace{\underbrace{\bm I_T}_{T \times T} \otimes \underbrace{\bm W_N}_{N \times N}}_{NT \times NT}=
\begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 & \cdots & 0  \\
      0 & 1 & \cdots & 0  \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right] =\\
\begin{pmatrix}
      \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right] & 0 & \cdots & 0  \\
      0 & \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right] & \cdots & 0  \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \cdots & \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1} w_{1} & v_{1} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{1} w_{m} \\
v_{2} w_{1} & v_{2} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{2} w_{m} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
v_{n} w_{1} & v_{n} w_{2} & \cdots & v_{n} w_{m}
\end{array}\right]
\end{pmatrix}
\end{split}
$$

Here we model only spatial dependence within each cross-section and multiply the same spatial weights matrix $T$ times. Off block-diagonal elements are all zero. So there is no spatial dependence that goes across time.

The error term can be decomposed into two parts:

$$
		{\bm u}= (\bm \iota_T \otimes {\bm I_N})\bm \mu+ {\bm \nu},
$$

where $\bm \iota_T$ is a $T \times 1$ vector of ones, ${\bm I_N}$ an $N \times N$ identity matrix, $\bm \mu$ is a vector of time-invariant individual specific effects (not spatially autocorrelated).

We could obviously extent the specification to allow for error correlation by specifying

$$
		{\bm \nu}= \lambda(\bm I_T \otimes {\bm W_N})\bm \nu + {\bm \varepsilon}.
$$

The individual effects can be treated as fixed or random.

__Fixed Effects__

In the FE model, the individual specific effects are treated as fixed. If we re-write the equation above, we derive at the well-know fixed effects formula with an additional spatial autoregressive term: 

$$
		{y_{it}}= \rho\sum_{j=1}^Nw_{ij}y_{jt} + \bm x_{it}\bm\beta + \mu_i + \nu_{it},
$$
where $\mu_i$ denote the individual-specific fixed effects.

As with the standard spatial lag model, we cannot rely on the OLS estimator because of the simultaneity problem. The coefficients are thus estimated by maximum likelihood [@Elhorst.2014].

__Random Effects__

In the RE model, the individual specific effects are treated as components of the error $\mu \sim \mathrm{IID}(o, \sigma_\mu^2)$. The model can then be written as

$$
\begin{split}
		{\bm y}= +\rho(\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm y}+{\bm X}{\bm \beta}+ {\bm u}, \\
		{\bm u}= (\bm \iota_T \otimes {\bm I_N})\bm \mu+ [\bm I_T \otimes (\bm I_N -  \lambda{\bm W_N})]^{-1} {\bm \varepsilon}.
\end{split}		
$$	

As with the conventional random effects model, we make the strong assumption that the unobserved individual
effects are uncorrelated with the covariates $\bm X$ in the model.

## Dynamic panel data models

Relying on panel data and repeated measures over time, comes with an additional layer of dependence / autocorrelation between units. We have spatial dependence (with its three potential sources), and we have temporal/serial dependence within each unit over time.

A general dynamic model would account for all sources of potential dependence, including combinations [@Elhorst.2012]. The most general model can be written as:

$$
\begin{split}
		{\bm y_t}=& \tau \bm y_{t-1} + \rho(\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm y}_t
		+ \gamma(\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm y_{t-1}}\\
		&~+ {\bm X}{\bm \beta}+ (\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm X}{\bm \theta}+ {\bm u}_t,\\
		{\bm u_t}=&  + (\bm \iota_T \otimes {\bm I_N})\bm \mu+ {\bm \nu_t},\\
		{\bm \nu_t}=& \psi{\bm \nu}_{t-1} + \lambda(\bm I_T \otimes {\bm W_N})\bm \nu + {\bm \varepsilon},
\end{split}		
$$	

Where ${\bm X}$ could further contain time-lagged covariates. Compared to the static spatial panel model, we have introduced temporal dependency in the outcome $\tau \bm y_{t-1}$ and the spatially lagged outcome $\gamma(\bm I_T\otimes {\bm W_N}){\bm y_{t-1}}$, and in the error term $\psi{\bm \nu}_{t-1}$.

### Impacts in spatial panel models

Note that similar to the distinction between local and global spillovers, we now have to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects. A change in $\bm X_t$ no influences focal $Y$ and neighbour's $Y$ but also contemporaneous $Y$ and future $Y$.

While the short-term effects are the known impacts

$$
\frac{\partial {\bm y}}{\partial {\bm x}_k} = ({\bm I}-\rho{\bm W_{NT}})^{-1}\left[\beta_k+{\bm W_{NT}}\theta_k\right].
$$

The long-term impacts, by contrast, additionally account for the effect multiplying through time  

$$
\frac{\partial {\bm y}}{\partial {\bm x}_k} = [(1-\tau){\bm I}-(\rho+\gamma){\bm W_{NT}}]^{-1}\left[\beta_k+{\bm W_{NT}}\theta_k\right].
$$

## Example: Local employment impacts of immigration

@Fingleton.2020: Estimating the local employment impacts of immigration: A dynamic spatial panel model. Urban Studies, 57(13), 2646–2662. https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098019887916

_This paper highlights a number of important gaps in the UK evidence base on the employment impacts of immigration, namely: (1) the lack of research on the local impacts of immigration – existing studies only estimate the impact for the country as a whole; (2) the absence of long-term estimates – research has focused on relatively short time spans – there are no estimates of the impact over several decades, for example; (3) the tendency to ignore spatial dependence of employment which can bias the results and distort inference – there are no robust spatial econometric estimates we are aware of._

_We illustrate our approach with an application to London and find that no migrant group has a statistically significant long-term negative effect on employment. EU migrants, however, are found to have a significant positive impact, which may have important implications for the Brexit debate. Our approach opens up a new avenue of inquiry into subnational variations in the impacts of immigration on employment._

## Estimation in R

To estimate spatial panel models in R, we can use the `splm` package of @Millo.2012.

We use a standard example with longitudinal data from the `plm` package here.

```{r}
data(Produc, package = "plm")
data(usaww)

head(Produc)

usaww[1:10, 1:10]
```


`Produc` contains data on US States Production - a panel of 48 observations from 1970 to 1986. `usaww` is a spatial weights matrix of the 48 continental US States based on the queen contiguity relation.

Let start with an FE SEM model, using function `spml()` for maximum likelihood estimation of static spatial panel models.

```{r}

# Gen listw object
usalw <- mat2listw(usaww, style = "W")

# Spec formula
fm <- log(gsp) ~ log(pcap) + log(pc) + log(emp) + unemp

### Esimate FE SEM model
semfe.mod <- spml(formula = fm, data = Produc, 
                  index = c("state", "year"),  # ID column
                  listw = usalw,          # listw
                  model = "within",       # one of c("within", "random", "pooling").
                  effect = "individual",  # type of fixed effects
                  lag = FALSE,            # spatila lg of Y
                  spatial.error = "b",    # "b" (Baltagi), "kkp" (Kapoor, Kelejian and Prucha)
                  method = "eigen",       # estimation method, for large data e.g. ("spam", "Matrix" or "LU")
                  na.action = na.fail,    # handling of missings
                  zero.policy = NULL)     # handling of missings

summary(semfe.mod)

```


A RE SAR model, by contrast, can be estimated using the following options:

```{r}

### Estimate an RE SAR model
sarre.mod <- spml(formula = fm, data = Produc, 
                  index = c("state", "year"),  # ID column
                  listw = usalw,          # listw
                  model = "random",       # one of c("within", "random", "pooling").
                  effect = "individual",  # type of fixed effects
                  lag = TRUE,             # spatila lg of Y
                  spatial.error = "none", # "b" (Baltagi), "kkp" (Kapoor, Kelejian and Prucha)
                  method = "eigen",       # estimation method, for large data e.g. ("spam", "Matrix" or "LU")
                  na.action = na.fail,    # handling of missings
                  zero.policy = NULL)     # handling of missings

summary(sarre.mod)
```

Note that @Millo.2012 use a different notation, namely $\lambda$ for lag dependence, and $\rho$ for error dependence.... 

Again, we have to use an additional step to get impacts for SAR-like models.

```{r}
# Number of years
T <- length(unique(Produc$year))

# impacts
sarre.mod.imp <- impacts(sarre.mod,
                         listw = usalw,
                         time = T)
summary(sarre.mod.imp)                         
```


There is an alternative by using the package `SDPDmod` by Rozeta Simonovska ([see vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SDPDmod/vignettes/spatial_model.html)).

```{r}
### FE SAR model
sarfe.mod2 <- SDPDm(formula = fm, 
                    data = Produc, 
                    W = usaww,                 
                    index = c("state","year"), # ID
                    model = "sar",             # on of c("sar","sdm"),
                    effect = "individual",     # FE structure
                    dynamic = FALSE,           # time lags of the dependet variable
                    LYtrans = TRUE)            # Lee-Yu transformation (bias correction)

summary(sarfe.mod2)
```

And subsequently, we can calculate the impacts of the model.

```{r}
# Impats
sarfe.mod2.imp <- impactsSDPDm(sarfe.mod2, 
                               NSIM = 200, # N simulations
                               sd = 12345) # seed

summary(sarfe.mod2.imp)
```

Note: I did not manage to estimate a dynamic panel model with `SDPDm`.
