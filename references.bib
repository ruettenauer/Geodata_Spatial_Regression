The standard model however does not allow for spatial processes to drive the choices made by decision makers. For example, whether one city increases its sales tax may depend the actions of neighboring cities. Whether one jurisdiction subsidizes the construction of a new sports arena depends on the options that are offered to the sports enterprise by other jurisdictions \textemdash{} which has been occurring with increasing frequency in the United States, at the threat of the team moving elsewhere. In both of these cases, the conventional probit model fails to account for interdependencies.},

  abstract = {Time-series cross-section (TSCS) data are prevalent in political science, yet many distinct challenges presented by TSCS data remain underaddressed. We focus on how dependence in both space and time complicates estimating either spatial or temporal dependence, dynamics, and effects. Little is known about how modeling one of temporal or cross-sectional dependence well while neglecting the other affects results in TSCS analysis. We demonstrate analytically and through simulations how misspecification of either temporal or spatial dependence inflates estimates of the other dimension's dependence and thereby induces biased estimates and tests of other covariate effects. Therefore, we recommend the spatiotemporal autoregressive distributed lag (STADL) model with distributed lags in both space and time as an effective general starting point for TSCS model specification. We illustrate with two example reanalyses and provide R code to facilitate researchers' implementation\textemdash from automation of common spatial-weights matrices (               W               ) through estimated spatiotemporal effects/response calculations\textemdash for their own TSCS analyses.},

In addition, we introduce and test the `environmental shielding hypothesis', which states that, given environmental `bads' in the neighbourhood, privileged social groups have better opportunities to shield themselves against them. Our results show that, for many residents of the four cities, observed road traffic and aircraft noise levels are above World Health Organization limits. Estimates of spatial error regression models only partly support the social gradient hypothesis. While we find significant but relatively small income effects and somewhat stronger effects of having a (non-Western) migration background, these effects are not significant in all cities. However, especially high-income households are more capable of avoiding exposure to indoor noise. Due to their residence characteristics and having the resources to maintain high standards of noise protection, these households have more capabilities to shield themselves against environmental bads in their neighbourhood. This supports the environmental shielding hypothesis.},

  abstract = {This paper highlights a number of important gaps in the UK evidence base on the employment impacts of immigration, namely: (1) the lack of research on the local impacts of immigration \textendash{} existing studies only estimate the impact for the country as a whole; (2) the absence of long-term estimates \textendash{} research has focused on relatively short time spans \textendash{} there are no estimates of the impact over several decades, for example; (3) the tendency to ignore spatial dependence of employment which can bias the results and distort inference \textendash{} there are no robust spatial econometric estimates we are aware of. We aim to address these shortcomings by creating a unique data set of linked Census geographies spanning five Censuses since 1971. These yield a large enough sample to estimate the local impacts of immigration using a novel spatial panel model which controls for endogenous selection effects arising from migrants being attracted to high-employment areas. We illustrate our approach with an application to London and find that no migrant group has a statistically significant long-term negative effect on employment. EU migrants, however, are found to have a significant positive impact, which may have important implications for the Brexit debate. Our approach opens up a new avenue of inquiry into subnational variations in the impacts of immigration on employment.},

The research on environmental inequalities and environmental justice has proposed several theories to explain such inequities; still, it remains unclear which of these theories applies to the German societal context. This research investigates whether individual-level income differences between Germans and migrants account for objectively measured exposure to the environmental goods and bads of land use, specifically soil sealing and green spaces. Marginal effects and predictions based on georeferenced survey data from the German General Social Survey reveal that Germans with higher incomes live in areas with better neighbourhood quality. Germans with lower incomes are exposed to fewer disadvantages stemming from land use, and there is no marginal difference between nonurban and urban municipalities. Spatial assimilation in high-income groups occurs; however, the difference in low-income groups can be explained by place stratification and discrimination in the housing market. While this study uses more indirect and non-hazardous measures of environmental quality \textendash{} in contrast to air pollution or noise \textendash{} it provides evidence that such indicators also create distributional injustices in Germany.},

Previous research on different forms of green spaces in the residential environment as a direct source of life satisfaction is scarce, and we know little about whether green spaces affect the decision to relocate. We address these topics with a two-equation model that estimates respondents' considerations to relocate while accounting for life satisfaction. With this strategy, we are able to test which aspects of residential greenery (window view, green environment, green yard, own garden, and balcony) are associated with one or both outcomes, controlling for life-course events and demographic characteristics. The data come from a primary survey conducted in two large German cities, Cologne and Hamburg, in 2020/21 (N = 1886). The results show that not having green elements in the window view, not having a green yard, and\textemdash exclusively for parents\textemdash not having a garden increase the likelihood of considering residential relocation. Not having a balcony and not having a garden are directly associated with decreased life satisfaction, and decreased life satisfaction triggers the willingness to relocate.},

The metropolitan structural characteristics that best distinguish micro-segregation from macro-segregation for each group combination are identified, and their effects are decomposed into portions due to racial variation occurring over short and long distances. A comparison of our results to those from tract-based analyses confirms the value of the new approach.}

Filling this void, Introduction to Spatial Econometrics presents a variety of regression methods used to analyze spatial data samples that violate the traditional assumption of independence between observations. It explores a wide range of alternative topics, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation, various types of spatial regression specifications, and applied modeling situations involving different circumstances. Leaders in this field, the authors clarify the often-mystifying phenomenon of simultaneous spatial dependence. By presenting new methods, they help with the interpretation of spatial regression models, especially ones that include spatial lags of the dependent variable. The authors also examine the relationship between spatiotemporal processes and long-run equilibrium states that are characterized by simultaneous spatial dependence. MATLAB\textbackslash circledR toolboxes useful for spatial econometric estimation are available on the authors' websites. This work covers spatial econometric modeling as well as numerous applied illustrations of the methods. It encompasses many recent advances in spatial econometric models-including some previously unpublished results. Presents formal, systematic motivations for spatial econometric regression models. Discusses simultaneous estimation of model parameters and model selection using MCMC model comparison methods and Bayesian model averaging. Offers unique, computational insights on determinants, weight matrices, and approaches for handling large spatial data sets. Addresses the economic implications of spatial models. Extends techniques to other settings, such as those with discrete dependent variables, flow data, spatiotemporal data, and panel data.

  abstract = {Regional scientists frequently work with regression relationships involving sample data that is spatial in nature. For example, hedonic house-price regressions relate selling prices of houses located at points in space to characteristics of the homes as well as neighborhood characteristics. Migration, commodity, and transportation flow models relate the size of flows between origin and destination regions to the distance between origin and destination as well as characteristics of both origin and destination regions. Regional growth regressions relate growth rates of a region to past period own- and nearby-region resource inputs used in production. Spatial data typically violates the assumption that each observation is independent of other observations made by ordinary regression methods. This has econometric implications for the quality of estimates and inferences drawn from non-spatial regression models. Alternative methods for producing point estimates and drawing inferences for relationships involving spatial data samples is the broad topic covered by spatial econometrics. Like any sub-discipline, spatial econometrics has its quirks, many of which reflect influential past literature that has gained attention in both theoretical and applied work. This article asks the question: ``What should regional scientists who wish to use regression relationships involving spatial data in an effort to shed light on questions of interest in regional science know about spatial econometric methods?''},

The increase of PT ridership is constrained by many aspects; among them, travel time and the built environment are considered the most critical factors in the choice of travel mode. We propose a data fusion framework including real-time traffic data, transit data, and travel demand estimated using Twitter data to compare the travel time by car and PT in four cities (S\~ao Paulo, Brazil; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We use real-world data to make realistic estimates of travel time by car and by PT and compare their performance by time of day and by travel distance across cities. Our results suggest that using PT takes on average 1.4\textendash 2.6 times longer than driving a car. The share of area where travel time~favours PT over car use is very small: 0.62\% (0.65\%), 0.44\% (0.48\%), 1.10\% (1.22\%) and 1.16\% (1.19\%) for the daily average (and during peak hours) for S\~ao Paulo, Sydney, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, respectively.

A systematic comparison between these two modes shows that the average travel time disparity is surprisingly similar across cities:                                                   \$\$R {$<$} 1\$\$                                        R                     {$<$}                     1                                                                  for travel distances less than 3 km, then increases rapidly but quickly stabilises at around 2.

We advance sociological research by introducing (random) regret minimization, which is related to loss aversion, into the sociological literature and by testing it against (random) utility maximization, which is the most prominent decision rule in sociological research on individual behaviour. With an application to neighbourhood choice, in a sample of four European cities, we combine stated choice experiment data and discrete choice modelling techniques and find a considerable degree of decision rule-heterogeneity, with a strong prevalence of regret minimization and hence loss aversion. We also provide indicative evidence that decision rules can affect expected neighbourhood demand at the macro level. Our approach allows identifying heterogeneity in decision rules, that is, the degree of regret/loss aversion, at the level of choice attributes such as the share of foreigners when comparing neighbourhoods, and can improve sociological practice related to linking theories and social research on decision-making.},

Several European governments have adopted policies to geographically disperse refugees. While many theoretical arguments and descriptive studies analyze the impact of spatially concentrated ethnic networks on immigrant integration, there is limited causal evidence that sheds light on the efficacy of these policies. We provide evidence by studying the economic integration of refugees in Switzerland, where some refugees are assigned to live in a specific location upon arrival and, by law, are not permitted to relocate during the first 5 y. Leveraging this exogenous placement mechanism, we find that refugees assigned to locations with many conationals are more likely to enter the labor market. This benefit is most pronounced about 3 y after arrival and weakens somewhat with longer residency. In addition, we find that, among refugees employed by the same company, a high proportion share nationality, ethnicity, or language, which suggests that ethnic residential networks transmit information about employment opportunities. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of the importance of ethnic networks for facilitating refugee integration, and they have implications for the design of refugee allocation policies.},

Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel, we show that variable spatial opportunity structures moderate the size of DESO at labour market entry, such that there are places where DESO disappears. Social origins assume greater importance as local labour market conditions deteriorate: in weak local labour markets, non-graduates are approximately 16 percentage points less likely to find employment if their parents are care workers rather than secondary school teachers, while graduates typically obtain first jobs that are 7\textendash 9 ISEI points lower in status.

Some scholars have argued that selective siting of industrial facilities accounts for such environmental inequality, while others have argued that those citizens who can afford to move out of polluted regions do so, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged are sorted into polluted areas. Yet empirical evidence regarding the processes of environmental inequality is not conclusive. We build on an original data set that includes annual georeferenced data of 6,570 highly polluting industrial facilities in Germany from 2008 to 2017 and validate the fluctuation in facilities with geographical land-use data. We then connect the facilities to income and demographic data for 4,455 municipalities and investigate sociodemographic changes before and after the appearance of new facilities. Spatial models are employed to measure local relative changes, and fixed-effects individual slopes estimators are used to account for selection on economic trajectories. Results provide only limited support for the selective siting thesis but show that an area's average income decreases after the appearance of new industrial facilities, thereby resonating with the selective migration hypothesis. In contrast, facility closure does not attract, or reattract, more affluent households.}

Our analysis uses data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the English Index of Multiple Deprivation, and employs multilevel models to account for individual-level deprivation, neighbourhood deprivation, and larger-scale area deprivation. We further investigate the interplay between those scales. On average we find that individual, neighbourhood, and larger area deprivation are associated with a higher likelihood of voting for ``Leave''. However, the impact of neighbourhood deprivation is heterogenous and depends on the broader spatial context: living in deprived neighbourhoods (and to a lesser extent also experiencing personal deprivation) has a greater impact on voting behaviour in more affluent regions. Conversely, the effect of individual and neighbourhood deprivation is close to zero and not statistically significant in more deprived areas of the country. These results indicate that social comparison processes of in- and out-groups operate within larger regional contexts. Our study thus emphasises the role of individual and regional deprivation but also their intersection in shaping political attitudes and outcomes.},

Spatial econometrics addresses the unique challenges posed by spatially dependent observations, where spatial relationships among data points can significantly impact statistical analyses. The chapter begins by exploring the fundamental concepts of spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation, and highlighting their implications for traditional econometric models. It then introduces a range of spatial econometric models, particularly spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial lag of X models, illustrating how these models accommodate spatial relationships and yield accurate and insightful results about the underlying spatial processes. The chapter provides an intuitive understanding of these models compare to each other. A practical example on London house prices demonstrates the application of spatial econometrics, emphasising its relevance in uncovering hidden spatial patterns, addressing endogeneity, and providing robust estimates in the presence of spatial dependence.},

Using bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association, we map hotspots where high flood exposure and high social vulnerability converge and identify dominant indicators of social vulnerability within these places. The hotspots, home to approximately 19 million people, occur predominantly in rural areas and across the US South. Mobile homes and racial minorities are most overrepresented in hotspots compared to elsewhere. The results identify priority locations where interventions can mitigate both physical and social aspects of flood vulnerability. The variables that most distinguish the clusters are used to develop an indicator set of social vulnerability to flood exposure. Understanding who is most exposed to floods and where, can be used to tailor mitigation strategies to target those most in need.},

These forces sharpen social segregation, which is reflected in fragmented social network structure. Geographical impediments such as distance and physical or administrative boundaries also reinforce social segregation. Yet, less is known about the joint relationships between social network structure, urban geography, and inequality. In this paper we analyze an online social network and find that the fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads. Towns in which neighborhoods are relatively distant from the center of town and amenities are spatially concentrated are also more socially segregated. Using a two-stage model, we show that these urban geography features have significant relationships with income inequality via social network fragmentation. In other words, the geographic features of a place can compound economic inequalities via social networks.}

In contrast, production-side theorists emphasise the movement of capital into previously disinvested neighbourhoods and contend that profit-seeking development increases property values and sparks gentrification. Hybrid theorists argue that consumption and production occur simultaneously. This article operationalises arguments made by each approach, and asks: Do gentrifiers precede rising home values or do rising home values precede gentrifiers? To answer this question of sequence, we build a dataset of census and property tax assessment data for 2192 New York City census tracts between 2009 and 2016. Using cross-lagged regression models with tract and year fixed effects, we find neighbourhoods that experienced an increase in White, middle-class residents had related housing price spikes in each of the subsequent two years. A 1\% increase in gentrifiers was associated with a subsequent 2.7\% increase in property values. However, housing market growth did not predict future increases in gentrifiers. This suggests that consumption leads production during neighbourhood gentrification, and that developers are reactive, not proactive, in their investment decisions. Focusing on the sequence of gentrification's subsidiary elements enables city officials, non-profits and social movements to better anticipate gentrification and develop more targeted policies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Previous cross-sectional studies highlight persistent East\textendash West differences in gender ideologies after German reunification. This study examines the extent to which gender ideologies in the East and West have converged and whether differences are still relevant for younger cohorts who experienced childhood around the time of reunification, or after 1989. Using data from the German Family Panel pairfam (2008\textendash 2019) and differences in regime-specific socialization for three cohorts born before and after reunification, results reveal that different dimensions of gender ideologies have only partly converged 30\,years after reunification. Attitudes towards housework and female employment converged particularly, yet, in all cohorts, views on maternal employment remain substantially different between East and West. Observed convergence occurred only partly due to contrasting trends of modernization in West Germany and re-traditionalization in East Germany. Moreover, the results highlight smaller attitude changes with increasing age, particularly for the younger cohorts, contributing to further variations in East\textendash West differences. Overall, the findings confirm the existence of long-lasting ideology differences due to regime-specific socialization, and a persistently altered composition of society in East and West Germany. At the same time, they point towards slow convergence among younger cohorts due to a more similar institutional and socialization context following reunification.},
